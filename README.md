# Library

This project is an innovative library where you can not only read books, but 
also create and edit event timelines. With the timeline feature, you can add 
events to the timeline and link them to other events that happened before or 
after. This helps you organize the events in your book and understand how 
they are connected to each other.

In our library, you can also search for books by author, universe, or timeline, 
and read them. Additionally, you can find events in the library, see when 
certain events happened relative to other events, and check if timelines 
intersect. The timeline feature is the killing feature of our library and will be 
created first. In addition to the timeline feature, our library also has an editor 
that allows you to write and edit your own book.
